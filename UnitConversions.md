# Unit Conversions and Physics 

*9/5/24* 

**DO NOW**: Old dial up modems transferred information at 300 baud (1 baud = 1 bit/second). At that rate how much does it take to download 19GB? (Answer in Notebook)

Note: use units that make sense.


**Rule for Calculus Conversions in Physics**

1. Units matter
2. All variables consist of numbers and units (e.g. dissect 19GB -> the unit is B, number is 19G)
    1. To convert, multiply by one

**Should we use SIG figs?**

1. Misleading claims regarding accuracy
2. Why not precision?
    1. Imagine that you have a 33.4 cm ruler to measure a 33.4 cm object. According to sig figs, that would make the ruler have a length of 33.4 Â± 33.4 cm.
